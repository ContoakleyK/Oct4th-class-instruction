df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)

Chapter 1 - Part 2

(Zip lists to build a DataFrame)
In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from Wikipedia.
Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd.
Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2).

# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped

zipped = list(zip(list_keys,list_values))


# Inspect the list using print()

print(zipped)


#Build a dictionary with the zipped list: 
data
data = dict(zipped)


# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: 
df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)

(Labeling your data)
You can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame.
In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from Wikipedia). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Your job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

# Build a list of labels: list_labels

list_labels = ['year','artist','song','chart weeks']


# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: 
df.columns
df.columns = list_labels

(Building DataFrames with broadcasting
You can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. In this exercise, you're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities.
Your job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

# Make a string with the value 'PA': 
state
state = 'PA'


# Construct a dictionary: 
data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}


# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: 
df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Print the DataFrame

print(df)

Chapter 1 - Part 3

(Reading a flat file)
In previous exercises, we have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's your turn! Your job is to read the World Bank population data you saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file.
The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. You will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.
Finish up by inspecting the result with df.head() and df.info() in the IPython Shell (changing df to the name of your DataFrame variable).
pandas has already been imported and is available in the workspace as pd.

# Read in the file: df1

df1 = pd.read_csv(data_file)


# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels

new_labels = ['year', 'population']


# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2

df2 = pd.read_csv(data_file, header=0, names=new_labels)


# Print both the DataFrames

print(df1)

print(df2)

(Delimiters, headers, and extensions)
Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that you encounter far too often.
In this exercise, you have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to you in the variable file_messy.
In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas.
Your job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for you, as you might do in a real data workflow.
You can learn about the option input parameters needed by using help() on the pandas function pd.read_csv().


# Read the raw file as-is: df1

df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)


# Print the output of df1.head()

print(df1.head())


# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2

df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment="#")


# Print the output of df2.head()

print(df2.head())


# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index

df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)


# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an Excel file without the index

df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)

(Plotting series using pandas)
Data visualization is often a very effective first step in gaining a rough understanding of a data set to be analyzed. Pandas provides data visualization by both depending upon and interoperating with the matplotlib library. You will now explore some of the basic plotting mechanics with pandas as well as related matplotlib options. We have pre-loaded a pandas DataFrame df which contains the data you need. Your job is to use the DataFrame method df.plot() to visualize the data, and then explore the optional matplotlib input parameters that this .plot() method accepts.
The pandas .plot() method makes calls to matplotlib to construct the plots. This means that you can use the skills you've learned in previous visualization courses to customize the plot. In this exercise, you'll add a custom title and axis labels to the figure.
Before plotting, inspect the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using df.head(). Also, use type(df) and note that it is a single column DataFrame.


# Create a plot with color='red'

df.plot(color='red')


# Add a title

plt.title('Temperature in Austin')


# Specify the x-axis label

plt.xlabel('Hours since midnight August 1, 2010')


# Specify the y-axis label

plt.ylabel('Temperature (degrees F)')


# Display the plot

plt.show()

(Plotting DataFrames)
Comparing data from several columns can be very illuminating. Pandas makes doing so easy with multi-column DataFrames. By default, calling df.plot() will cause pandas to over-plot all column data, with each column as a single line. In this exercise, we have pre-loaded three columns of data from a weather data set - temperature, dew point, and pressure - but the problem is that pressure has different units of measure. The pressure data, measured in Atmospheres, has a different vertical scaling than that of the other two data columns, which are both measured in degrees Fahrenheit.
Your job is to plot all columns as a multi-line plot, to see the nature of vertical scaling problem. Then, use a list of column names passed into the DataFrame df[column_list] to limit plotting to just one column, and then just 2 columns of data. When you are finished, you will have created 4 plots. You can cycle through them by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.
As in the previous exercise, inspect the DataFrame df in the IPython Shell using the .head() and .info() methods.

# Plot all columns (default)

df.plot()

plt.show()


# Plot all columns as subplots

df.plot(subplots=True)

plt.show()


# Plot just the Dew Point data

column_list1 = ['Dew Point (deg F)']

df[column_list1].plot()

plt.show()


# Plot the Dew Point and Temperature data, but not the Pressure data

column_list2 = ['Temperature (deg F)','Dew Point (deg F)']

df[column_list2].plot()

plt.show()
